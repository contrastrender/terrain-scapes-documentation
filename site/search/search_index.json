In most cases this is the first part of the environment creation, because you can define the basic layout of your scene. The addon uses a non-distructive workflow, which means you can change / delete settings at any given state.</p> <p>The addon comes with a wide range of premade heightmaps, which you can be stacked ontop of each other. This enables a very fast workflow, because the erosion and other properties are already contained by the heightmaps and dont need to be calculated. Furthermore Masks can be added for custom control of the heightmaps.</p>"},{"location":"heightmap/#setup","title":"Setup","text":"<p>In order to use the addon properly, you need to add a catalog of heightmaps, which can then be added to your terrain.</p> <p>A catalog is a directory containing following structure:</p> <pre><code>Catalog\n    Categorie 1\n    Categorie 2\n        Heightmap 1\n        Heightmap 2\n            heightmap.png\n            preview.png\n        ...\n    ...\n</code></pre> <p>There is a premade catalog available with this product, containing an extensive range of different heightmaps, but you can also create your own catalog containing your custom heightmaps using this structure.</p> <p>After adding such catalog, you can see the heightmaps and categories listed in the preferences window.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"heightmap/#adding-terrain","title":"Adding Terrain","text":"<p>After installing and setup the addon properly, you should see the heightmap panel when pressing \"n\" in the 3d-viewport.</p> <p>By clicking the \"Add Terrain\" button, a new terrain gets created, you can work with.
