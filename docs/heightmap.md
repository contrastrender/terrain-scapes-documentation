# Heightmap

## Setup

In Order to use the addon properly, you need to add a catalog of heightmaps, which can then be added to your terrain.

A catalog is a directory containing following structure:

    Catalog
        Categorie 1
        Categorie 2
            Heightmap 1
            Heightmap 2
                heightmap.png
                preview.png
            ...
        ...

There is a premade catalog available with this product with an extensive range of different heightmaps, but you can also create your own catalog containing your custom heightmaps using this structure.

## Using heightmaps

## Using Masks

You can add masks for the whole terrain or for a specific heightmap. The mask is a texture containing values from 0 - 1.

Here is a overview of the different masks:
