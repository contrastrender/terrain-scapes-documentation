# Vegetation

After the structure of the terrain is defined, you can add trees, grass and vegetation. The T. S. Vegetation Addon is optimized for handling large amounts of instances, which makes the process of forest creation on large scale scenes very efficent.

The addon comes with a wide range of assets including trees, grass, and plants. Those assets can be accessed and scattered across the emitter directly from the asset browser. Other asset libraries can also be used using the asset browser.
